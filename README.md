# House Classification Using Transfer Learning VGG16

This is a project aimed at classifying houses using transfer learning with the VGG16 model. The dataset used for this project is the Houses Dataset from Kaggle.

The project is divided into two main parts: data preprocessing and model building. In the data preprocessing part, the raw image data is resized, normalized, and transformed into numerical features that can be used as input to a machine learning model. In the model building part, transfer learning with the VGG16 model is used to classify the houses based on their images
